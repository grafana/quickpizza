## What is QuickPizza? üçïüçïüçï

`QuickPizza` is a web application, used for demonstrations and workshops, that generates new and exciting pizza combinations! 

The app is built using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) for the frontend and [Go](https://go.dev/) for the backend.

The tests written for `QuickPizza` demonstrates the basic and advanced functionalities of k6, ranging from a basic load test to using different modules and extensions.

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Grafana k6](https://k6.io/docs/get-started/installation/) (v.0.46.0 or higher)

## Run locally with Docker

To run the app locally with Docker, run the command:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 3333:3333  ghcr.io/grafana/QuickPizza-local:latest
```

or build image from the repo:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 3333:3333 $(docker build -q .)
```

That's it!

Now you can go to [localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333) and get some pizza recommendations!

## Use k6 to test QuickPizza

All tests live in the `k6` folder. Within this folder, you will find the following folders:

- [foundations](k6/foundations/) - covers the basic functionalities of k6.
- [browser](k6/browser/) - covers a more deep-dive look on how to use the [k6 browser module](https://k6.io/docs/using-k6-browser/overview/) for browser and web performance testing.
- [disruptor](k6/disruptor/) - covers a more deep-dive look on how to use [xk6-disruptor](https://k6.io/docs/javascript-api/xk6-disruptor/) for failure injection testing.
- [advanced](k6/advanced) - covers tests that are more advanced such as hybrid tests, tracing, etc.

To run tests on the `foundations` folder, you can use the following commands:

```bash
cd k6/foundations
k6 run 01.basic.js
```

If you want to run one iteration with one virtual user, you can use the following command:

```bash
k6 run --iterations 1 --vus 1 01.basic.js
```

If QuickPizza is [deployed remotely](#deploy-quickpizza-docker-image), then pass the hostname and port through the `BASE_URL` environment variable as follows:

```bash
k6 run -e BASE_URL=https://acmecorp.dev:3333 01.basic.js
```

If the test uses an extension, you need to build it first via xk6. To build the extension using Docker, you can run the following command:

```bash
cd k6/foundations/extension

docker run --rm -e GOOS=darwin -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v "${PWD}:/xk6" \
  grafana/xk6 build  \
  --with xk6-internal=.
```

Note that the `GOOS` variable is for Mac. Please refer to [Build a k6 binary using Docker](https://k6.io/docs/extensions/guides/build-a-k6-binary-using-docker/) for more information.

To run the test that uses an extension, you can run the following command:

```bash
./extension/k6 run 11.extension.js
```

## Collect telemetry 

Testing something you can't observe is only half the fun. QuickPizza is instrumented using best practices to record logs, emit metrics, traces and allow profiling. You can either collect and [store this data locally](#local-setup) or send it to [Grafana Cloud](#grafana-cloud).

### Local Setup

The [docker-compose-local.yaml](./docker-compose-local.yaml) file is set up to run and orchestrate the QuickPizza, Grafana, Tempo, Prometheus, Pyroscope, and Grafana Agent containers.

The Grafana Agent collects observability data from the QuickPizza app and forwards it to the Tempo, Prometheus, and Pyroscope services. Then, you can visualize and correlate the data with a local running Grafana instance.

To start the local environment, use the following command:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-local.yaml up -d --build
```

Like before, QuickPizza is available at [localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333). It's time to discover some fancy pizzas!

Then, you can visit the Grafana instance running at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access QuickPizza data.

![Pyroscope Data Source](./docs/images/local-grafana-with-pyroscope.png)

Please refer to [agent-local.river](./contrib/agent-local.river) to find the labels applied to the telemetry data.

### Grafana Cloud

The [docker-compose-cloud.yaml](./docker-compose-cloud.yaml) file is set up to run the QuickPizza and Grafana Agent containers. 

In this setup, the Grafana Agent collects observability data from the QuickPizza app and forwards it to [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/).

You will need the following settings:
1. The name of the [Grafana Cloud Stack](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/account-management/cloud-portal/#your-grafana-cloud-stack) where the telemetry data will be stored. 
2. An [Access Policy Token](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/account-management/authentication-and-permissions/access-policies/) that includes the following scopes for the selected Grafana Cloud Stack: `stacks:read`, `metrics:write`, `logs:write`, `traces:write`, and `profiles:write`.

Then, create an `.env` file with the following environment variables and the values of the previous settings:

```bash
GRAFANA_CLOUD_STACK=
GRAFANA_CLOUD_TOKEN=
```

Finally, execute the Docker Compose command using the `docker-compose-cloud.yaml` file as before:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-cloud.yaml up -d --build
```

QuickPizza is available at [localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333). Click the `Pizza, Please!` button and discover some awesome pizzas!

Now, you can log in to [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/) and explore QuickPizza's telemetry data on the Prometheus, Tempo, and Pyroscope instances of your Grafana Cloud Stack. Refer to [agent-cloud.river](./contrib/agent-cloud.river) to find the labels applied to the telemetry data.

***Enable Frontend observability (Grafana Faro)***

Frontend observability is available exclusively in Grafana Cloud. To enable [Grafana Cloud Frontend Observability](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/monitor-applications/frontend-observability/) for QuickPizza, add the `QuickPizza_CONF_FARO_URL` variable to the `.env` file, setting its value to your Faro web URL:

```bash
QuickPizza_CONF_FARO_URL=
```

Restart the `docker-compose-cloud.yaml` environment.

## Deploy QuickPizza Docker image

The [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) contains the setup for running QuickPizza without collecting data with the Grafana agent. 

You can use the Dockerfile or build a Docker image to deploy the QuickPizza app on any cloud provider that supports Docker deployments. For simplicity, here are the `Fly.io` instructions:

1. [Authenticate using the fly CLI](https://fly.io/docs/speedrun/). 
2. Then, run the CLI to deploy the application and set up the internal port `3333` that the server listens to.
    ```bash
    fly launch --internal-port 3333 --now
    ```

For deployments on remote servers, you need to pass the `BASE_URL` environment variable when running the k6 tests as follows:

```bash
k6 run -e BASE_URL=https://acmecorp.dev:3333 01.basic.js
```

## Deploy application to Kubernetes

If you want to run a test that uses [xk6-disruptor](https://k6.io/docs/javascript-api/xk6-disruptor/), or want to experiment with distributed tracing, you will need to deploy QuickPizza to Kubernetes. 

For a detailed setup instructions, see the [QuickPizza Kubernetes guide](./docs/kubernetes-setup.md).

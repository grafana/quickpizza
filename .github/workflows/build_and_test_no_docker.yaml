# NOTE:
# It is important that these actions are run for every PR, no matter what
# other actions are added. The ones here are testing the actual code pushed
# instead of a possibly outdated image. Additionally, we also run formatters
# and linters here.
# Do not modify this file unless you really need to. You very likely don't need to.
